## Weekly Agricultural Market Prices in Ghana

This repo contains weekly market prices (2009 to 2014) from the Ministry of Agricultural website (mofa.gov.gh).

Since all the files are `.pdf`, I tranformed them into `.csv` files to make it easy for anyone to import into any statistical program to carry out their analysis.

All <"">scraping and reformatting was done in R.
