## Weekly Agricultural Market Prices in Ghana

This repo contains weekly market prices (2009 to 2014) from the Ministry of Agricultural website (mofa.gov.gh).

Since all the files are `.pdf`, I tranformed them into `.csv` files to make it easy for anyone to import into any statistical program to carry out their analysis.

All <a href="https://github.com/DavidQuartey/Weekly-Agric-Market-Prices/blob/master/R%20code/download_2009_to_2014_food_prices.R"> scraping<a/> and reformatting was done in R.
